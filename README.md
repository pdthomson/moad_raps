## Welcome to Moad Raps!
The idea behind this personal project is that I myself Love photography, I also love to go to different places and see new thigns! I have been to 48 states ALL but Hawaii and Alaska! I have taken tons of photos all over and have had amazing experiences. I wanted to build something that I could upload an image that ive taken in a particular state and make my own personal US photo map!

## Technologies
- Ruby on Rails
- Javascript
- html/css
- ActiveStorage(for the images)
- Pry
- Rspec

## The Big Idea
I would love to eventually make this app a multi user platform with functionality such as, comments likes and the ability to create and download your very own personal picture map! Photos are memories for a particular time why not cement that into something you can look at and share experiences with as many people as you can connect with!
