## Welcome to Moad Raps!
The idea behind this personal project is that I love photography and exploring new places! I have been to 48 states (all but Hawaii and Alaska) and have taken tons of photos along the way, creating amazing experiences. I wanted to build something where I could upload an image that I've taken in a particular state and create my own personal US photo map!

## Technologies
- Ruby on Rails
- Javascript
- html/css
- ActiveStorage(for the images)
- Pry
- Rspec

## The Big Idea
I would love to eventually make this app a multi-user platform with features such as comments, likes, and the ability to create and download your very own personal picture map! Photos are memories of a particular time and place, so why not create something you can look at and share experiences with as many people as you can connect with?
